I want to address the disconnect people feel from environmental issues facing our world. Many, especially those in landlocked states, do not realize that this global crisis will also directly affect them. The effects of these disasters seem far off and less pressing than other concerns. Even in the natural state, many people disassociate themselves from the environmental concerns facing our global community, such as air pollution, plastic pollution, and climate change. This dangerous disconnect prevents people from taking the actions that our world desperately needs. 
My love for the world and for people inspires me to tackle this problem. I have always loved nature and the opportunities offered outside. I enjoy camping, watersports, beach days, skiing, and many other activities that you can never truly experience indoors. I want my children and future generations to experience nature and the great outdoors in the same manner. However, the way things are going, I am scared that this will become impossible. I am also worried that they will not have the opportunity to observe wildlife in its natural habitats as pollution wreaks havoc on delicate ecosystems. Not to mention, the environmental crisis will have disastrous effects for the world population. Millions will lose their homes, the air in much of the world will be unbreathable, and many people will die. I know that I have to fight to oppose this harsh reality. 
I, alongside several of my peers, decided to address this problem with the youth in our community. Children are open-minded, explorative, and persistent, making them the perfect demographic to create change. We attended the Plastic Ocean Pollution Solution Summit in California to learn how to implement our ideas. There, we networked with other groups from across the globe and heard from experienced presenters. Then, we created a field trip curriculum for 3rd-5th grade students. Our group taught each class about the reality of plastic pollution and took them to Fourche Creek to experience the contamination. Fourche Creek is a local polluted creek that eventually flows into the Atlantic Ocean. From there, we had the opportunity to attend the Ocean Heroes Bootcamp in Louisiana. When we returned, we decided to create a similar experience for students in Arkansas. So, we started planning our own conference and took our idea to the University of Arkansas at Little Rock STEM Education Center, who agreed to partner with us to make the event free for all attendees. The Arkansas Youth Environmental Conference, as we named it, aimed to empower 4th-7th grade students to create and implement their own projects in the community. To do this, we designed fun activities, invited presenters and speakers with expertise in the environmental or political field, and paired each group with a local mentor to create their projects. Although we have had to cancel subsequent conferences due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this is a fight that I plan to continue.
